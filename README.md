# Social Network Analysis - Pakistani National Assembly

This repository contains the final project for the CS457 course on Social Network Analysis. The project focuses on web scraping the Pakistani National Assembly website to extract data related to the standing committees for the 2013 and 2018 National Assemblies. By constructing an undirected social network graph based on the extracted data, the project explores the connections between members within the same standing committee and conducts insightful analysis on the resulting network graphs.

## Project Overview

The project revolves around analyzing the social network within the Pakistani National Assembly based on the standing committee data. The following steps were performed as part of the project:

1. Web scraping: Data was extracted from the Pakistani National Assembly website for the standing committees of the 2013 and 2018 National Assemblies.
2. Network graph construction: An undirected social network graph was constructed using the extracted data, where each member within the same standing committee is connected to each other.
3. Analysis: The resulting network graphs were analyzed to gain insights into the connections, centrality measures, community detection, and other interesting patterns within the network.
4. Visualization: Visualizations were created to present the network graphs and key findings in an intuitive and informative manner.
